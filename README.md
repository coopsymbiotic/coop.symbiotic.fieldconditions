CiviCRM field conditions
========================

Ever had a custom field whose possible values depended on the values of another field?

For example,

* if "Field A" has options "1,2,3,4",
* and "Field B" has options "x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3, z1, z2, z3"
* but x* can only be selected if FieldA = 1, y* can only be selected if FieldA  = 2, etc?

This extension may help.

In some ways, it is similar to how the state_province/country fields work, but for custom fields.

BIG WARNING
===========

This code was not initially meant for public release. It is a subset of a quick hack done for a client project.

It is not meant to be used by end-users at this point, since it is missing a general solution for the javascript bit (see example JS below).

Example JS
==========

This is a rather terrible quick and dirty example. It can be improved in many ways. Provided here only to give a rough idea.

```
  CRM.myExample = function(map_id, dest_field_id, value, extract_element, origin_element) {
    var $select = $('.crm-case-customdata-row-' + dest_field_id + ' select');

    // Only update the list if no selection was already done.
    // Also protect against a change event triggered by another list being programmatically updated.
    if (CRM.myChangeInProgress || $select.val()) {
      return;
    }

    $('.crm-case-customdata-row-' + dest_field_id).append('<div class="crm-loading-element" style="float: right; height: 16px;"></div>');

    CRM.myChangeInProgress = true;

    var params = {};
    params['map_id'] = map_id;

    // If "other", do not send the value, so that we get all options possible.
    if (value != 9999 && value != 99999) {
      params[origin_element] = value;
    }

    $.ajax(CRM.url('civicrm/fieldconditions/ajax/field-filter-values'), {
      data: params,
      dataType: 'json',
      success: function(data) {
        $select.html('');

        CRM.status(data.length + ' items');

        $.each(data, function(index, element) {
          $select.append($('<option></option>')
            .attr('value', element[extract_element + '_value'])
            .html(element[extract_element + '_label']));
        });

        $select.change();
        $('.crm-case-customdata-row-' + dest_field_id + ' > .crm-loading-element').remove();
        CRM.myChangeInProgress = false;
      },
      error: function(data) {
        CRM.alert("Network communication error. Please try again.");
        $('.crm-case-customdata-row-' + dest_field_id + ' > .crm-loading-element').remove();
        CRM.myChangeInProgress = false;
      },
    });
  };

  CRM.myExample(1, 2, $(this).val(), 'dest', 'source');
```
